Write a program that creates a text file with the following and save it on your laptop with the data: “myFile.txt” – Kalahari, Gobi, Sahara, Kyzyl, Mojave, Karakum, Great Basin, and Taklamakan. 

Now the program reads the data from this file one at a time and puts it in an array but only the names that starts with G and K. Print to show the elements of the array.

Insert into the array two more data points – ‘Thar’ and ‘Namib’. Print to show the updated elements of the array.

Create a method to do a binary search. Test the search with ‘Gobi’ and ‘Kalahari’; print results for both.
